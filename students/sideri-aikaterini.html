                    I’m Katerina Sideri and I was born in 12/9/07 in Thessaloniki. I’ve been a really active child ever since I could walk. I always loved exercising and trying out new things even tho I was scared to. While I was trying to figure out my self and my preferences I stumbled on to a lot of things. Over the years I have a tremendous amount of experience in sports such as boxing , karate , swimming, gymnastics but the one of them that took my heart was dance. I’ve been dancing and competing since I was 8 years old and I’ve never stopped since. However in all these years something else caught my attention as much. Computer science. I always desired to make my own website and feel that breathtaking feeling of being proud of my creation. Now that I had the chance to make the decision of what I want to be in the future I chose the 2 things I loved most. Dancing and programming. Therefore to this day I’m still competing as a professional dancer and also studying computer science.
