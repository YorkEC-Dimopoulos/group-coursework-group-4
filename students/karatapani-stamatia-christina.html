                <p>
                    I’m Mat I am 20 years old and I’m originally from Rhodes, Greece and currently studying computer science in Thessaloniki. I choose to spend my free time tattooing, drawing, going to the gym and hanging out with my friends. I would say I’m a pretty extroverted person, I enjoy social gatherings and being with people in general. I would also say that I’m both a dog and cat person, I really just like having the company of a pet. I am also a pretty active person I frequently go tot he gym, as I mentioned, and growing up I have indulged in many activities such as track, tennis, football, volleyball, swimming and wind surfing while also attending martial arts classes like judo, taekwondo and kick boxing. As for my future I would like to able to somehow combine working in computer science while also having time to work as a tattoo artist.
